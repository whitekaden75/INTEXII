# Frontend Authentication Refactor Summary

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the extensive frontend authentication and API improvements implemented, including proactive token refresh, React Query integration, route protection, and error handling.

---

## Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)

- **Centralized auth state** with:
  - `user` info
  - `csrfToken`
  - `tokenExpiry`
  - `refreshTimer`
- **Proactive token refresh**:
  - After login or refresh, decode JWT expiry.
  - Set a timer to refresh token 1 minute before expiry.
  - Clear timer on logout or refresh failure.
- **Removed refresh logic from Axios interceptors**:
  - Now, on 401 errors, tokens are cleared and user redirected to login.
- **Login, register, refresh, logout**:
  - Store JWT and CSRF token.
  - Decode JWT to update user state.
  - Manage refresh timer.
- **Axios interceptors**:
  - Attach JWT and CSRF token to requests.
  - On 401, clear tokens and redirect.
- **ProtectedRoute** component:
  - Redirects unauthenticated users away from protected pages.

---

## React Query Integration

- **Replaced manual fetches with React Query**:
  - Movies list in `MovieContext.tsx`
  - Movie recommendations in `MovieDetail.tsx`
- **401 error handling**:
  - On 401, clear tokens and redirect to login.
  - Implemented via `useEffect` on query errors.
- **Removed manual loading/error state management**:
  - Use React Query's `isLoading` and `error`.

---

## Movie Context (`MovieContext.tsx`)

- **Removed manual fetch with `useEffect`** for movies.
- **Added React Query `useQuery`** for movies list.
- **Removed local `movies` and `loading` state**.
- **Updated filtering and recommendations** to use React Query data.
- **Removed `setMovies` calls** in add, update, delete movie functions.
- **Added error handling via `useEffect`** on query errors.

---

## Movie Detail Page (`MovieDetail.tsx`)

- **Replaced manual fetch with `useEffect`** for recommendations.
- **Added React Query `useQuery`** for recommendations.
- **Added error handling via `useEffect`** on query errors.
- **Removed duplicate imports and undefined variables**.
- **Commented out unimplemented `rateMovie` call**.

---

## Routing (`App.tsx`)

- **Wrapped protected routes** (`/movies`, `/movies/:id`, `/admin`) with `ProtectedRoute`.
- **Public routes** (`/login`, `/register`, `/privacy`, `/`) remain accessible without auth.

---

## Additional Improvements

- **Skipped refresh attempts** on public routes to avoid infinite loops.
- **Cleared tokens and timers** on logout and refresh failure.
- **Proactive refresh** reduces failed requests due to token expiry.
- **Improved error messages** for auth failures and API errors.

---

## Next Steps (Planned)

- Convert other API calls to React Query.
- Add global error boundary.
- Improve UI feedback with spinners and messages.
- Add MFA and email confirmation flows.
- Add role-based UI controls.
- Write tests for auth and API flows.

This refactor significantly improves frontend authentication robustness, maintainability, and user experience.
